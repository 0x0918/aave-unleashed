# ðŸš§ Under construction: oracles

* [https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/the-core-protocol/price-oracle#getfallbackoracle](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/the-core-protocol/price-oracle#getfallbackoracle)
* fallback oracles deprecated and handed over to governance

**Defi Spartan(24/03/2022) - from discord**

* The Fallback Oracle doesnâ€™t have any code, itâ€™s just a contract that allows for the manual input of prices in the event of a complete Oracle failure that needs manual intervention.
* The fallback Oracle has never been used, and Iâ€™m honestly not sure what a use case for it would be given the redundancy of Chainlink oracles.\
