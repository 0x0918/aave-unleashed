# Supply & Borrow Caps

* **Borrow Caps:** allow to modulate how much of each asset can be borrowed, which reduces insolvency risk.
* **Supply Caps**: allow to limit how much of a certain asset is supplied to the Aave protocol. This helps reducing exposure to a certain asset and mitigate attacks like infinite minting or price oracle manipulation.
