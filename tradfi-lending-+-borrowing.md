# TradFi: Lending + Borrowing

In the traditional financial world, lending and borrowing have long been the cornerstone of economic growth and financial stability. Banks and financial institutions have facilitated these essential activities, providing individuals and businesses with access to capital and liquidity.&#x20;

In traditional finance, lending involves individuals or institutions lending their funds to borrowers in exchange for interest payments. Banks act as intermediaries, managing the lending process and assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers. Borrowers, on the other hand, leverage these funds to finance projects, expand their businesses, or meet personal financial needs. Interest rates in traditional finance are influenced by factors such as market conditions, central bank policies, and the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Parallel to the traditional lending model, on-chain lending and borrowing protocols like Aave enable users to lend their crypto assets to borrowers or borrow assets by providing collateral. The lending process is executed through smart contracts, **removing the need for intermediaries and enabling a peer-to-peer approach.**

Similar to traditional finance, on-chain lending and borrowing protocols provide individuals with opportunities to earn interest by lending their assets. Lenders supply liquidity to the protocol, which is then accessed by borrowers who require funds for various purposes. However, in the DeFi space, interest rates are determined algorithmically, influenced by factors such as supply and demand dynamics, utilization rates, and protocol-specific mechanisms.

Furthermore, the collateralization aspect in on-chain lending introduces a unique feature not commonly found in traditional finance. **\<Overcollateralisation>** Borrowers must lock up a portion of their crypto assets as collateral, which serves as a safeguard for lenders in case of default. This collateralization mechanism enhances the security and stability of the lending process, providing lenders with reassurance and borrowers with access to funds they need.

On-chain lending protocols like Aave offer a decentralized, transparent, and accessible alternative to traditional financial systems. They enable individuals from all corners of the world to participate in lending and borrowing activities, without the limitations and complexities associated with traditional intermediaries.
