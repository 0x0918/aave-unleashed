# .updateState

## TLDR

The updateState function serves to update the interest and indexes within the system for a specific asset.

### Code

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (126).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If state has been updated within the same block in a previous transaction, do nothing. \
Else this function does two things:

1. **\_updateIndexes** => updates Indexes: `nextLiquidityIndex`, `nextVariableBorrowIndex`
2. **\_accrueToTreasury** => updates Treasury accrual&#x20;

## &#x20;`_updateIndexes`&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (130).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Updates `nextliquidityIndex` by the way of `calculateLinearInterest`, and updates `nextVariableBorrowIndex` by the way of `calculateCompoundInterest`.

* supply interest is accrued via linear interest (simple interest)
* borrow interest is accrued via compound interest&#x20;

### `calculateLinearInterest`

Calculates linear interest accrued from `lastUpdateTimeStamp` till current `block.timestamp`.

* serves to update deposit interest and liquidity index
* explanation: [deposit-interest](../../deposit-and-borrow-interest.md#deposit-interest)

### `calculateCompoundInterest`

Calculates interest accrued from `lastUpdateTimeStamp` till current `block.timestamp`.&#x20;

* interest is compounded every second&#x20;
* serves to update variable borrow interest and variable borrow index
* explanation: [borrow-interest](../../deposit-and-borrow-interest.md#borrow-interest)

## **\_accrueToTreasury**&#x20;

This function serves to update the amount accrued to Aave's Treasury - this value is stored in `reserve.accruedToTreasury` as a uint128.

* Note that indexes have been updated just earlier, in `_updateIndexes`.
* Amount newly accrued is not minted - this occurs via: _**rjp**_ [_**FILL IN**_](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

{% hint style="info" %}
* Treasury accrues funds in aTokens
* Difference between what borrowers' pay and suppliers' receive is accrued to the Treasury
* This is represented by the reserve factor: % of borrow rate that goes to Treasury.
{% endhint %}

#### Process

Firstly total debt accumulated from `lastUpdateTimestamp` till now has to be calculated. Total debt consists of both variable and stable debt.

For variable debt, the increase is accounted for by:

Note that `nextVariableBorrowIndex` is the most recent index - the consequence of the earlier execution of `_updateIndexes`. Whereas `currVariableBorrowIndex` is the prior index, that occured at lastUpdatedTimestamp.&#x20;

Essentially,

<mark style="color:red;">**For stable debt, the increase is accounted for by:**</mark>

[\<come back and fill in >](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]



**Now that we have gotten the total debt accrual:**&#x20;

* interest accrued to treasury = totalDebtAccrued \* reserveFactor
* this value is reflected as amountToMint in the code

If amountToMint is a non-zero value, `reserve.accruedToTreasury` is incremented by:

* `amountToMint / nextLiquidityIndex`&#x20;

This scales the amount against the most recent index; similar to how deposits are scaled.
