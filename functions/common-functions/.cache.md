# .cache

## TLDR

The cache function creates a cached copy of struct `ReservesData` in memory, as `reserveCache` to avoid repeated calls to storage which are expensive.&#x20;

Essentially, `reserveCache` will serve as the working copy within which data will be modified and updated through the course of execution.

* Caches `ReserveData` into `ReserveCache` struct
* `ReserveData` exists in storage, `ReserveCache` exist in memory
* Read/Write calls to memory are cheaper than storage

* Each reserve (asset) in Aave has its own unique configuration, rates, indexes, and token contracts (aToken and other debt tokens).
* For each reserve, this data is captured within a struct `ReserveData`. These structs are accessed via the mapping  `_reserves`, which maps the asset address to its corresponding `ReserveData`.
* `_reserves` is defined on PoolStorage.sol which is inherited by Pool.sol

{% code title="PoolStorage.sol" %}
```solidity
// Map of reserves and their data (underlyingAssetOfReserve => reserveData)
  mapping(address => DataTypes.ReserveData) internal _reserves;
```
{% endcode %}

### Caching reserve into reserveCache

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (177).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>reserveData -> reserveCache</p></figcaption></figure>

```solidity
// reservesData is PoolStorage::_reserves
DataTypes.ReserveData storage reserve = reservesData[params.asset];
DataTypes.ReserveCache memory reserveCache = reserve.cache();
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Basically cache serves to map the data held within `reserve` onto `reserveCache, by unpacking and through some calculations`
{% endhint %}

## Code

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (63).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### 1. Get ReserveConfigurationMap reserveConfiguration&#x20;

```solidity
reserveCache.reserveConfiguration = reserve.configuration;
```

* simply copies `reserveConfigurationMap` from storage to memory &#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (117).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### 2. Get reserveFactor

```solidity
reserveCache.reserveFactor = reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getReserveFactor();
```

The value of `reserveFactor` is obtained by passing `reserveConfiguration` obtained earlier, into function `getReserveFactor`

* `getReserveFactor`, like its name implies, returns the value of `reserveFactor` which is stored as a uint256 variable within reserveCache&#x20;
* `reserveFactor`, amongst other data, is stored within `ReserveConfigurationMap`, which is a bitmap

{% hint style="info" %}
The reserve factor is a percentage of protocol interest which goes to the Aave Ecosystem Reserve. The rest of the borrow interest goes to the suppliers.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (182).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### It does 3 things:

* Bitwise NOT of RESERVE\_FACTOR\_MASK: **`~`**`RESERVE_FACTOR_MASK`
* Bitwise AND: `data`` `**`&`** **`~`**`RESERVE_FACTOR_MASK`
* Right shift the result of the above by `RESERVE_FACTOR_START_BIT_POSITION`

#### RESERVE\_FACTOR\_MASK

```solidity
// 64 characters (we ignore the leading 0x)
0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
```

This is a 256-bit hexadecimal number, represented by 64 hexadecimal characters.&#x20;

* each hex character represents 4 bits => 4 \* 64 = 256 bits

In binary: first 176 bits are all `1` (represented by `F` in hexadecimal), followed by 16 zeros, and ending with another 64 bits of `1`.

{% hint style="info" %}
`0xF` can be directly interpreted in binary as such:&#x20;

`F` = 15 = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = `1111`
{% endhint %}

#### **`~`**`RESERVE_FACTOR_MASK`

The tilde is the bitwise NOT operator -> it flips the bits, changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (176).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Notice that only the bits 64-79 are now `F`, which corresponds to the range of bits that contain the `reserveFactor` value as seen in `ReserveConfigurationMap`
* #### **`~`**`RESERVE_FACTOR_MASK: 0x00..FFFF..00` &#x20;

#### `data`` `**`&`** **`~`**`RESERVE_FACTOR_MASK`

* `&` is the operator for bitwise AND operation
* AND operation returns `1` only if both the bits are `1`.
* `data AND 0x00..FFFF..00:`&#x20;
  * this means that it is only possible for the result of the operation to contain 1s within the range of 64-79
  * all other bits will be zero, as a bitwise ADD operation with a 0 will result in 0.
  * so we have the possibility of 1s occurring within 64-79 bit, if the corresponding bit in self.data, is also 1.

{% hint style="info" %}
The purpose of the mask is to wipe out all other irrelevant data, while extracting only the relevant portion of the bitmap
{% endhint %}

#### Right shift ( >> )

To illustrate this portion, let us assume the result so far is as follows:

```
0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 F0FF 0000000000000000 
```

* The result is right shifted by `RESERVE_FACTOR_START_BIT_POSITION`
* `RESERVE_FACTOR_START_BIT_POSITION = 64`

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (67).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We see that the trailing zeros are dropped off, and replaced as leading zeros. Essentially, the section of bits corresponding to `reserveFactor` is moved all the way to the end.

**Why?**

**In short, right shifting such that the trailing zeros are removed so that the value is left-padded, results in the proper representation of a number.**

In Solidity, strings and bytes are padded on the lower-order (right) side with zero-bytes, while other types (such as numbers and addresses) are padded on the higher-order side.

As an example, this is how we would store the string "abcd" in one full word (32 bytes):

`0x6162636400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

This is how the number `0x61626364` would be stored:

`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000061626364`

{% hint style="info" %}
uint256 (and other numbers) are left-padded.
{% endhint %}

### 3. Get `currLiquidityIndex` and `nextLiquidityIndex`

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="false" %}
```solidity
reserveCache.currLiquidityIndex = reserveCache.nextLiquidityIndex = reserve.liquidityIndex;
```
{% endcode %}

* both `currLiquidityIndex` and `nextLiquidityIndex` get their value from `liquidityIndex` held in ReserveData
* expect `nextLiquidityIndex` to be updated in the coming sections

### 4. Get `currVariableBorrowIndex` and `nextVariableBorrowIndex`

```solidity
reserveCache.currVariableBorrowIndex = reserveCache.nextVariableBorrowIndex = reserve
      .variableBorrowIndex;
```

* similarly, both are obtained from variableBorrowIndex, in ReserveData
* expect `nextVariableBorrowIndex` to be updated in the coming sections.

### 5. Get `currLiquidityRate`

```solidity
reserveCache.currLiquidityRate = reserve.currentLiquidityRate;
```

* obtained from `currentLiquidityRate`

### 6. Get `currVariableBorrowRate`

```solidity
reserveCache.currVariableBorrowRate = reserve.currentVariableBorrowRate;
```

* obtained from `currentVariableBorrowRate`

### 7-10. Token Addresses

```solidity
    reserveCache.aTokenAddress = reserve.aTokenAddress;
    reserveCache.stableDebtTokenAddress = reserve.stableDebtTokenAddress;
    reserveCache.variableDebtTokenAddress = reserve.variableDebtTokenAddress;

    reserveCache.reserveLastUpdateTimestamp = reserve.lastUpdateTimestamp;
```

Values are obtained as follows:

| ReserveData              | ReserveCache               |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| aTokenAddress            | aTokenAddress              |
| stableDebtTokenAddress   | stableDebtTokenAddress     |
| variableDebtTokenAddress | variableDebtTokenAddress   |
| lastUpdateTimeStamp      | reserveLastUpdateTimeStamp |

### 11. Get `currScaledVariableDebt` & `nextScaledVariableDebt`

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```solidity
reserveCache.currScaledVariableDebt = reserveCache.nextScaledVariableDebt = IVariableDebtToken(reserveCache.variableDebtTokenAddress).scaledTotalSupply();
```
{% endcode %}

`IVariableDebtToken(reserveCache.variableDebtTokenAddress).scaledTotalSupply()`



### 12. Get `currPrincipalStableDebt`, `currAvgStableBorrowRate`, `currTotalStableDebt`

```solidity
    (
      reserveCache.currPrincipalStableDebt,
      reserveCache.currTotalStableDebt,
      reserveCache.currAvgStableBorrowRate,
      reserveCache.stableDebtLastUpdateTimestamp
    ) = IStableDebtToken(reserveCache.stableDebtTokenAddress).getSupplyData();
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (163).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><code>getSupplyData()</code></p></figcaption></figure>

* currPrincipalStableDebt => IncentivizedERC20::totalSupply() => IncentivizedERC20
* currTotalStableDebt => \_calcTotalSupply(avgRate)

### 13. Get next`AvgStableBorrowRate, nextTotalStableDebt`

```solidity
// by default the actions are considered as not affecting the debt balances.
// if the action involves mint/burn of debt, the cache needs to be updated

reserveCache.nextTotalStableDebt = reserveCache.currTotalStableDebt;
reserveCache.nextAvgStableBorrowRate = reserveCache.currAvgStableBorrowRate;
```
