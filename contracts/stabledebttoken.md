# StableDebtToken

We will examine stableDebtToken contract in this section.

## getSupplyData

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (161).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>getSupplyData</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

This function is called in .cache, and we will explain each component.&#x20;

{% code title=".cache(...)" %}
```solidity
(
  reserveCache.currPrincipalStableDebt,
  reserveCache.currTotalStableDebt,
  reserveCache.currAvgStableBorrowRate,
  reserveCache.stableDebtLastUpdateTimestamp
) = IStableDebtToken(reserveCache.stableDebtTokenAddress).getSupplyData();
```
{% endcode %}

### super.totalSupply()

* Inherited from IncentivizedERC20.sol
* Essentially a getter function for the internal storage variable `_totalSupply`

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>IncentivizedERC20.sol</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
On \_totalSupply:

* Reflects total stable debt, accounting for interest accrued from inception till **`_totalSupplyTimestamp`.**
* Does not account for interest accrued from **`_totalSupplyTimestamp`**` ``to now.`
{% endhint %}

### \_totalSupply

Total stable debt, accounting for interest accrued since inception till  `_totalSupplyTimestamp`**.** `_totalSupply` is incremented on `mint`, decremented on `burn`.

**Example:** a stable borrow is taken some time after `_totalSupplyTimestamp`&#x20;

* `_totalSupply += stableBorrowAmount + unbooked interest`&#x20;

`_totalSupply` is incremented to account for the incoming borrow as well as the interest accrued in the period since `_totalSupplyTimestamp`**.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Assigned to `currPrincipalStableDebt, in .cache`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
* `_totalSupply` is declared in `IncentivizedERC20`
* `_totalSupplyTimestamp` is declared in `StableDebtToken`
{% endhint %}

### \_calcTotalSupply(avgRate)

Calculates total stable debt, accounting for interest accrued to date.&#x20;

* `avgRate` is `_avgStableRate`
* `principalSupply is _totalSupply`

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* calculates interest compounded from `_totalSupplyTimestamp` till now (`block.timestamp`)
* `_totalSupplyTimestamp`: Timestamp of the last update of \_totalSupply
  * updated in `mint` & `burn`

{% hint style="info" %}
Assigned to `currTotalStableDebt`, in .cache
{% endhint %}

**Why do we calculate interest from `_totalSupplyTimestamp`?**

Every time `mint` or `burn` is called, `_totalSupply` is updated such that it accounts for the interest accrued since previous update till now, as well as the `mint`/`burn` amount.&#x20;

For example, at the start of `mint`

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From this, we can see that `_totalSupply` is updated with the interest accrual from previous timestamp till now.

Since this occurs on each function call that would modify `_totalSupply`, the definition of principalStableDebt is to distinguish from accounted interest and floating, unaccounted interest.&#x20;

### \_avgStableRate

* internal storage variable
* weighted average rate, calculated across all stable borrows

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Simply put, assume there are 3 stable borrows at differing times:

* 1: 100 DAI at 1%
* 2: 200 DAI at 2%
* 3: 300 DAI at 3%

weighted average rate = (100 \* 1%) + (200 \* 2%) + (300 \* 3%) / (100 + 200 + 300) = **2.3%**

**\_avgStableRate = 2.3%**

{% hint style="info" %}
**ReserveCache contains the following:**&#x20;

* currPrincipalStableDebt => `super.totalSupply()`&#x20;
* currTotalStableDebt => `_calcTotalSupply(avgRate)`
* currAvgStableBorrowRate => `_avgStableRate`
* stableDebtLastUpdateTimestamp => `_totalSupplyTimestamp`

**`Also`**

* nextAvgStableBorrowRate = currTotalStableDebt&#x20;
* nexTotalStableDebt = currAvgStableBorrowRate&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## balanceOf

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The balance for any address is calculated to account for interest accrued since the last interaction.

{% hint style="info" %}
* each user's stable rate is stored at `_user[account].additionalData`&#x20;
* `_timestamps[account]` stores the timestamp of their last interaction
{% endhint %}

## totalSupply()

Declared on StableDebtToken.sol.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**`_calcTotalSupply(_avgStableRate)`**

* [`super.TotalSupply()`](stabledebttoken.md#super.totalsupply)  returns `_totalSupply`; accounts for interest from inception till `_totalSupplyTimestamp`.
* [`_calcTotalSupply`](stabledebttoken.md#\_calctotalsupply-avgrate) will compound this with the recently accrued interest, from `_totalSupplyTimestamp` till now.

Therefore, `totalSupply` returns the total stable debt, accounting for all interest to date.&#x20;

## mint

Let's examine mint, from the pretext that is has been called via `executeBorrow`.

`mint` is called via the interface `IStableDebtToken`, `reserve.currentStableBorrowRate` is passed as a param.

* variable is cached to avoid unnecessary calls to storage: `currentStableRate`

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### **\_calculateBalanceIncrease**&#x20;

calculates the increase in balance due to compounding interest, for a specific user, since the previous &#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### **Update \_totalSupply**&#x20;

```solidity
vars.previousSupply = totalSupply();
vars.currentAvgStableRate = _avgStableRate;
vars.nextSupply = _totalSupply = vars.previousSupply + amount;
```

* `_totalSupply` is updated to be `previousSupply + amount`
* `previousSupply` reflects total stable debt and recently accrued interest as explained in [totalSupply](stabledebttoken.md#totalsupply)
* hence, `_totalSupply` is incremented to account for both unbooked interest and incoming borrow.

#### **Calculate nextStableRate**

`reserve.currentStableBorrowRate` is passed as `rate`.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```solidity
vars.currentStableRate = _userState[onBehalfOf].additionalData;
vars.nextStableRate = (vars.currentStableRate.rayMul(currentBalance.wadToRay()) + vars.amountInRay.rayMul(rate)).rayDiv((currentBalance + amount).wadToRay());

_userState[onBehalfOf].additionalData = vars.nextStableRate.toUint128();
```
{% endcode %}

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* From now till the next future interaction, interest will compound at the nextStableRate.
* This is reflected in [balanceOf](stabledebttoken.md#balanceof), in **\_calculateBalanceIncrease** section.

#### **Calculate updated average stable rate**

```solidity
// Calculates the updated average stable rate
vars.currentAvgStableRate = 
_avgStableRate = (
  (vars.currentAvgStableRate.rayMul(vars.previousSupply.wadToRay()) +  rate.rayMul(vars.amountInRay)).rayDiv(vars.nextSupply.wadToRay())
).toUint128();

```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### \_mint&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* increments user's balance by amount
* makes a call to \_incentivesController, should it be defined

{% hint style="info" %}

## Global currentStableBorrowRate and users' local borrow rate

There is a global stable rate determined by a model; each user accrues interest based on the stable rate they locked-in. How does this work?

### **Global stable rate**

Each asset in Aave has its configuration data contained within a struct **`ReserveData`**. This can be accessed via an internal mapping **`_reserves`**.

Held in storage, each `ReserveData`, contains a uint128 variable `currentStableBorrowRate`.&#x20;

* This is the stable rate enjoyed by incoming stable borrows, regardless of user.
* This global value is determined by the Utilization model we described above.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Held in storage, the ReserveData struct contains variable: `currentStableBorrowRate`**
{% endhint %}

### **User's stable rate**

Upon taking up a stable loan, the rate enjoyed by the user is stored in `_userState[address].additionalData`, as defined on the stableDebtToken contract.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (235).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>StableDebtToken is IncentivizedERC20</p></figcaption></figure>

* `.additionalData` is his weighted average stable rate, based on all his previous borrows.
* This is the rate at which interest compounds for the user.
* Each time a new stable borrow is taken, this is incremented:&#x20;
  * `(oldAmount * oldRate) + (newAmount * newRate) / totalAmount`

{% hint style="info" %}
**`_userState[address].additionalData`**` ``is updated within the`` `**`mint`**` ``function of stableDebtToken.`
{% endhint %}

### **\_avgStableRate**

An internal storage variable on the stable debt token contract, it is the weighted average rate across all the stable borrows taken to date, system-wide.&#x20;

Incremented like so:

**`_avgStableRate`**` ``= (currrentAvgStableRate * previousSupply) + (newRate * newAmount) / (_totalSupply() + newAmount)`

{% hint style="info" %}
Difference between **`_avgStableRate`**` ``and`` `**`currentStableBorrowRate`**

* **`_avgStableRate`**` ``reflects the average rate at which interest is being accrued by stable borrowers`
* **`currentStableBorrowRate`**` ``is the rate for the next incoming stable borrow as determined by the Utilization model.`
{% endhint %}

### **`borrow & mint`**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (236).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

`mint` returns the following two values which are stored in `reserveCache`:&#x20;

* `reserveCache.nextAvgStableBorrowRate` = `vars.currentAvgStableRate`&#x20;
* `reserveCache.nextTotalStableDebt` = `vars.nextSupply`

They are used later in **`calculateInterestRates`** to update system-wide rates.

### **updateInterestRates::calculateInterestRates**

After a loan is taken, **`calculateInterestRates`** is ran to update the system-wide rates:

* Liquidity rate
* Stable borrow rate
* Variable borrow rate

**`totalStableDebt`** used to calculate `totalDebt` and **`averageStableBorrowRate`** used to calculate `overallBorrowRate`, and consequently, `currentLiquidityRate`.

Stable borrow rate is updated, accounting for increase in stable loans taken; as are the other rates.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
The updated stable rate is stored in **`reserve.currentStableBorrowRate - in storage.`**
{% endhint %}
