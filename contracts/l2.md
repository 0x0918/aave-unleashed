# L2

### Background

Moving execution off of the main chain allows for significantly decreased costs for execution and state storage. However, rollups still must post their data to the layer-1 chain to ensure data availability.

Essentially, rollups pay cheap, layer-2 costs for execution and storage, but must still pay layer-1 fees to post their data.

This can be seen on the "Advanced TxInfo" tab on any transaction in the ArbiScan block explorer. The transaction fee is broken down into the calldata costs to post to L1, the computation used on L2, and the L2 storage. And in almost all transactions, the L1 calldata will be the primary driver of fees.

For example, breakup of $4.19 Uniswap Trade on Arbitrum ([explorer](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xeab92f1bfa00f2cfacf50056cdd74df1fd7f3266ee0f7cc076121cc9a45e2341#txninfo)):

* L1 Fixed Cost: $1.77
* L1 Calldata Cost: $2.30
* L2 Computation: $0.12

You can see that, the calldata cost is over 50%.

Simply put: posting data to Layer-1 is the primary bottleneck for fees on rollups.

## PriceOracleSentinel

Price Oracle sentinel mainly aimed for L2s to handle eventual downtime of the sequencers by introducing a grace period for liquidations and ability for RISK\_ADMINS to disable borrowing for a reserve under specific circumstances.

The high throughput, scalability, and low cost of L2 networks mean that most of the assets from Aave on Ethereum will be transferred to L2s. To mitigate some of the issues that may arise in L2 networks, V3 introduced an advanced price oracle sentinel. The sentinel feature was designed specifically to handle any eventual downtime centralized block producers on L2s may experience.

L2 networks use these block producers, called sequencers, alongside distributed validation to increase throughput and support two queues for pending transactions—one on-chain requiring L1 transactions and another off-chain operated by the sequencer. The sequencers often experience downtime, which is usually short in length and has little impact on L2 users. However, if the downtime lasts longer, the network fails to produce new blocks and off-chain transactions may be rejected or dropped.

Aave relies on L2s as it uses oracle price feeds. When the sequencers experience downtime, the protocol’s price feeds aren’t updated. This creates the possibility of slow flash crashes when the sequencer comes up.

To solve this, V3 introduces a grace period for liquidations and disables borrowing when it detects a sequencer is down.

Supporting more L2 network is also a goal of V3. To solve the problem of untimely update of Layer 2 prices caused by Layer 1 congestion in extreme cases, Aave proposed Price Oracle Sentinel.

It means that when the L2 price update/transaction record is delayed, the user's liquidated position will have a grace period before the next block is produced. That is to say, the user's position will not be liquidated before the oracle price is updated, but the user will not be able to borrow any more during this period.

## L2 encoder

* Contract of view functions
* Helper contract to encode calldata, used to optimize calldata size in L2Pool for transaction cost reduction
* Only indented to help generate calldata for uses/frontends.

Generates compact calldata via view functions -> gas-free. Compacted calldata is the used in L2Pool as params.&#x20;
